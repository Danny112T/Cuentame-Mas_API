    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll walk through how to [LoRA fine-tune](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) an LLM with MLX LM. We'll use the [HellaSwag](https://rowanzellers.com/hellaswag/) dataset for common sense reasoning as an example. An outline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the dataset and prepare it in the right format for MLX LM.\n",
    "2. Setup and run LoRA training. We'll show how to capture the training logs and plot some statistics to visualize the performance.\n",
    "3. Evaluate on the test set. We'll compute the final question-answer accuracy of the fine-tuned model.\n",
    "4. Fuse the resulting adapters into the base model and upload to Hugging Face.\n",

    "### Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "To figure out why your LoRA adapters are not working well it's critical to plot both the trianing loss and validation loss over the duration of fine-tuning. There are really only two cases to consider: underfitting or overfitting. And you can figure out which regime you are in based on the above plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Underfitting**: The trianing loss is not low enough and the validation loss closely matches the training loss. You could also measure the accuracy on the training set itself for question-answering style tasks like HellaSwag. If you are in this regime you have a few options to improve the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use more adapters. Increase `lora_layers` or adapt more of the linear layers within a given block by setting `lora_parameters[\"keys\"]`.\n",
    "- Use a higher rank. A higher rank means more parameters per adapter.\n",
    "- If you are using dropout, decrease the droupout rate or turn it off entirely.\n",
    "- Sometimes, underfitting issues are really optimization issues. In these cases it can be helpful to tune the learning rate or learning rate schedule.\n",
    "- If none of the above works, try a bigger model. For example, try Phi-3 medium instead of Phi-3 tiny.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overfitting**: The trianing loss keeps going down but the validation loss stops going down and even starts to go up. If you are in this regime you also have a few options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The best thing to do is to use more trianing data if you have it.\n",
    "- Contrary to the underfitting regime decreasing the capacity of the model can help. For example, use fewer adapters, a lower LoRA rank, or a smaller model size.\n",
    "- If you are not using dropout, use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find your adapters work well pre-fusion but stop working post-fusion, try tuning the `scale` parameter, $c$, prior to fine-tuning. Typically the adapters have a smaller magnitude than the weights, so using a larger scale helps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Use\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning a large LM with LoRA requires a machine with a decent amount of memory. Here are some tips to reduce memory use should you need to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Try quantization (QLoRA). You can use QLoRA by generating a quantized model with `mlx_lm.convert` and the `-q` flag or by using an already quantized model from HuggingFace.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try using a smaller batch size. You can set the `batch_size` parameter in the `TrainingArgs` or pass `--batch-size` if you are using the CLI. The default is 4 so setting this to 2 or 1 will reduce memory consumption. Note, this may slow things down a little..\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduce the number of layers to fine-tune with by setting `lora_layers` to a smaller value or passing `--lora-layers` if you are using the CLI. The default is `16`, so you can try `8` or `4`. This reduces the amount of memory needed for back propagation. It may also reduce the quality of the fine-tuned model and you may need to compensate with a larger `rank`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Longer examples require more memory. If it makes sense for your data, one thing you can do is break your examples into smaller sequences when making the `train`, `valid`, and `test` data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient checkpointing lets you trade-off memory use (less) for computation (more) by recomputing instead of storing intermediate values needed by the backward pass. You can use gradient checkpointing by passing `grad_checkpoint=True` to the `TrainingArgs` or the `--grad-checkpoint` flag if using the CLI. Gradient checkpointing will be more helpful for larger batch sizes or sequence lengths with smaller or quantized models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- To learn more about MLX check-out the [GitHub repo](http://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) and [documentation](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/)\n",
    "- For more on MLX LM check-out the [MLX LM documentation](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples/tree/main/llms#readme).\n",
    "- Check out the other [MLX Examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples/tree/main). These are great as a learning resource or to use as a starting point for a new project.\n",
